# TIMELOOP SOLUTION
# can a nesting .py file for our control circuit code
# issues:
# 1) waits for the set interval to run the program for the first time
# --> resolved by calling for the lampOn() before any looping starts, nt crucial for fans and pumps
# 2) MIGHT NOT WORK ON RASPBERRY PI --> MULTITHREADING IS WEIRD
